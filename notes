all card headers should have text-16px weight-600 like:
Personal Information
Verify Your Phone
Fleet Configuration
Boat 1 Details
Subscription Plan
pricing summary
payment method
payment details
etc...

In the sign up flow I want to align all the text sizes and weight across the components
Here are some examples: (first screen in sign-up flow: choose your account type)
Choose Your Account Type weight-600 size 20px px text-[#030712]
Select the option that best describes your role in
the fish supply chain weight-400 text-[#6A7282] size 14px

All Select options-
Fish Producer weight-600 text-16px
Boat owners and fish producers - weight-400 text-14px

Go to personal info button text-14px weight-500

Make the card titles like: Personal Information - Berify OTP
weight-600 size-16px

Make all labels and inputs weight-500 and not bold examples:
Full Name
Phone Number
National Id Number
Boat Name
Registeration Number
Boat Capacity

I want you to align all the similar componetns in the flow with these examples and sizes and UI instructions and make the flow compatable and focus changes on text and font for all the compoentts
